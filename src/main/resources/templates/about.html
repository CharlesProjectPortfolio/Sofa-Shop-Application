        We are a family owned and operated furniture store specializing in luxurious and custom sofas. If you can dream it,
        we can make it. From starting off as a small, one shop operation in Dallas Texas, led by Bernard William Sr. we have grown
        to a regional custom furiture store with over fifteen location in four states.

    <p style="background-color: lightgray; width:70%">
        Furniture is an investment in your home and your future and we believe it should be treated as such. That's what Bernard
        thought and why he decided to take a chance and start his own company. He believed people should be able to get high quality
        furniture at a reasonable price. He also believed people should be able to get furniture that is custom made for them to perfectly
        fit their homes. We have carried this belief with us all the way from that one shop and it is the reason we have grown into such a
        reputable and respected company.
